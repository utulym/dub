# Dub.co Link Management: Real-Time Analytics, Conversion Tracking, Modern Attribution Platform

So you're drowning in marketing links and have no idea which ones actually work? Yeah, I've been there. Welcome to the world of Dub.co – the link management platform that's making tools like Bitly look like they're stuck in 2008 (which, let's be honest, they kind of are).

Here's the thing about Dub. It started as a side project by some talented developer who worked at Vercel. You know the type – builds something cool on weekends, people actually start using it, and suddenly he's quitting his day job to work on it full-time. Classic startup story, except this one actually delivers.

## What Makes Dub Different (Without the Marketing BS)

Look, I'm not going to waste your time with flowery language about "revolutionary link solutions." Dub does three things really well: it shortens links, tracks what happens to those links, and helps you run affiliate programs. The difference is it does all this without making you want to throw your laptop out the window.

The platform handles over 100 million clicks monthly and powers links for companies like Twilio, Buffer, Framer, Perplexity, and Vercel. These aren't small operations experimenting with new tools – they're serious businesses that need reliable infrastructure.

### Real-Time Analytics That Actually Work

Remember checking your link analytics and wondering if the data was from last week? With Dub, you post something on social media and immediately see when someone clicks your link, where they're from, and what platform referred them. Not five minutes later. Not "within the hour." Right now.

One user mentioned they make smoothie videos for nearly 2 million YouTube subscribers and Dub has become essential for them. Another review from a software comparison site said they tried "every single option available on the market, Bitly, Short.io, self-hosted miscellaneous services" before settling on Dub as "the only tool we've felt congruent paying for."

### Conversion Tracking for Marketers

Here's where things get interesting for the marketing crowd. Dub's conversion tracking connects directly to your payment systems. If you're running a Shopify store, setup is basically plug-and-play. For SaaS businesses using Stripe or Polar, you'll need some engineering work upfront, but once it's configured, you get data that shows exactly how your marketing drives actual revenue.

According to reviews, this is "a marketer's dream" – finally seeing the full journey from first click to conversion without juggling five different analytics tools.

### Dub Partners: The Affiliate Platform

Dub Partners is their full affiliate management solution, and it's built differently than most platforms out there. While competitors like Impact or PartnerStack still rely on third-party cookies (which browsers now block), Dub Partners uses first-party tracking. This means nothing gets blocked, every referral gets properly attributed, and your affiliates actually get credit for their work.

They've already processed over $10 million in payouts to creators worldwide, handling tax compliance and invoicing automatically. Companies like Framer report this saves them 40+ hours per month on administrative work.

## Pricing Breakdown: What You Actually Get

Let me break down what Dub costs without the usual pricing page confusion:

| Plan | Monthly Price (Annual) | Links/Month | Tracked Clicks/Month | Key Features |
|------|----------------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 25 | 1,000 | Real-time analytics, 3 custom domains, API access, 30-day retention, QR codes, UTM templates |
| **Pro** | $25 ($19 billed yearly) | 1,000 | 50,000 | Advanced link features, free .link domain, link folders, deep links, 1-year retention |
| **Business** | $75 ($59 billed yearly) | 10,000 | 250,000 | Conversion tracking, A/B testing, customer insights, webhooks, Dub Partners included, 3-year retention, $2.5K partner payouts/mo |

| **Enterprise** | Custom | Unlimited | Unlimited | SSO/SAML, audit logs, custom SLA, unlimited retention, unlimited partner payouts |

The free plan is genuinely useful – not one of those "14-day trial then pay us" situations. You get 1,000 tracked clicks per month, which is plenty if you're just starting out or running a small operation.

For most small teams and creators, the Pro plan at $25/month hits the sweet spot. You get 50,000 tracked clicks and access to advanced features like custom link previews, geo-targeting, and password protection.

The Business plan is where conversion tracking kicks in, which is essential if you're actually trying to measure ROI on your marketing. At $75/month (or $59 yearly), it includes Dub Partners and can handle $2,500 in monthly partner payouts with a 5% fee.

## What Advanced Features Actually Mean

Let me translate some of the feature list into plain English:

**Custom Link Previews**: When someone shares your link on Twitter, LinkedIn, or WhatsApp, you control what image and text shows up. According to Dub, this can increase click-through rates by up to 30%.

**Device & Geo Targeting**: Send iPhone users to the App Store and Android users to Google Play with the same link. Or redirect people in different countries to localized landing pages.

**Link Cloaking**: Your affiliate links look cleaner and more trustworthy because they use your domain instead of showing long, messy tracking URLs.

**A/B Testing**: Test different landing pages with the same short link to see which converts better. No need for separate tools.

**Deep Links**: Direct users to specific pages within your mobile app with deferred deep linking support.

## Real User Reviews (The Good and The Honest)

Let's talk about what actual users say. The Product Hunt reviews are overwhelmingly positive, with comments like "couldn't live without Dub at this point" and "hands down the best" compared to Bitly.

One particularly detailed review mentioned Dub saves them "at least 4 hours of work weekly" and gave them back control over their placed links. Another user from Cal.com specifically praised the clean UI, ease of embedding in their product, and how the fraud detection feature provides peace of mind.

The G2 reviews highlight the intuitive dashboard, professional-looking branded links, and smooth partner payout system. Analytics update reliably in real time, and the browser extension lets users generate short links instantly without opening the dashboard.

Are there complaints? Sure. Some users mention the Pro account pricing can feel prohibitive for individuals. A few wish the analytics had deeper device-level insights or more detailed conversion tracking options. But compared to competitors, these are relatively minor gripes.

On Trustpilot, Dub has mixed reviews with an overall positive lean. The customer support gets consistent praise for being "super helpful and fast to reply." One creator with nearly 2 million YouTube subscribers called Dub "a necessity" for their work.

## Who Actually Needs This

Dub works best for:

- **Content creators** sharing links across YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and other platforms who want to know what's actually driving traffic
- **Marketing teams** running campaigns that need reliable attribution and conversion tracking
- **SaaS companies** building or managing affiliate programs without the overhead of traditional platforms
- **Agencies** managing links for multiple clients who need organized folders, team access, and detailed analytics

It's probably overkill if you're just sharing the occasional link with friends or running a small blog with minimal traffic. The free plan handles that fine, but you might not need all the advanced features.

## The Technical Stuff (For Those Who Care)

Dub is open-source, which means you can actually look at the code. One developer review mentioned they don't even use Dub but "learned a lot by digging through its source code" because "the code is well written and easy to follow."

The platform offers robust API access with native SDKs for TypeScript, Python, Go, and Ruby. Rate limits range from 600 requests per minute on the Pro plan to custom limits for Enterprise customers.

For developers building link infrastructure into their apps, Dub provides webhooks for real-time events, conversion tracking APIs, and even an embedded referral dashboard you can white-label for your users.

Cal.com creates over 200,000 links per month through Dub's API for their SMS workflows. Raycast uses it for tracking analytics when customers use their screenshot tool. These aren't trivial integrations – they're core infrastructure.

## Setting Up: How Long Does It Actually Take?

If you just want basic link shortening, you're up and running in about 5 minutes. Connect a custom domain, create your first link, done.

For conversion tracking with Shopify, it's genuinely plug-and-play. Connect your store and Dub starts tracking clicks and sales immediately.

The Stripe integration for SaaS businesses requires more work – you'll need engineering resources to configure it properly. But once set up, one company mentioned they "shipped a referral program directly inside" their product in less than a week, including the referral UI, attribution, reward logic, and payouts.

## Comparing to Alternatives

**vs Bitly**: Dub's interface is cleaner, analytics are more detailed, and you get free custom domains on all plans. Bitly's been around longer but hasn't innovated much in the past decade.

**vs Rebrandly**: Similar feature sets, but Dub's conversion tracking and affiliate platform give it an edge for businesses focused on ROI.

**vs PartnerStack/Impact**: These are pure affiliate platforms that cost significantly more and don't include link infrastructure. Dub combines both at a lower price point with better tracking accuracy.

**vs Short.io**: Both are modern platforms, but Dub's open-source approach and built-in conversion tracking make it more appealing for technical teams.

## Current Promotions and Deals

Based on my research, Dub doesn't frequently run promotional discount codes. The platform focuses on providing value through its features rather than constant sales.

However, annual billing gives you an automatic 17% discount across all paid plans. That means the Pro plan drops from $25/month to $19/month, and Business goes from $75/month to $59/month.

Some review sites mention occasional partner-specific discounts, but these aren't publicly advertised. Your best bet is to start with the free plan and upgrade when you actually need the additional features.

## Things to Watch Out For

The analytics and link limits are tracked separately. This means you can keep creating links even if you've exceeded your monthly click quota – your analytics just stop updating until next month. Not ideal, but better than having links break.

If you delete a link, it doesn't reduce your usage for the current month. The limits reset monthly regardless.

Root domain redirects don't count toward your tracked clicks limit, which is nice if you're using that feature.

The free plan limits some advanced features to Pro and above: custom link previews, device targeting, geo targeting, link cloaking, expiration, password protection, and A/B testing.

## Bottom Line

Dub works. It's not revolutionary in the sense of doing something completely new – link shorteners have existed forever. It's revolutionary in actually making the experience pleasant and providing data you can use.

The free plan is generous enough for individual creators. The Pro plan at $25/month handles small teams well. The Business plan at $75/month makes sense once you're serious about conversion tracking or running affiliate programs.

Is it perfect? No. Could the analytics be more detailed? Sure. Are there features you might want that aren't there yet? Probably. But the team ships updates quickly (check their changelog), they're responsive to feedback, and the core product is solid.

Most importantly, it does what it says it does. Your links work, the analytics update in real-time, and you're not fighting with a clunky interface built in 2008.

If you're currently using Bitly or managing links across spreadsheets, give Dub's free plan a try. Worst case, you're out nothing. Best case, you save yourself hours of headache and actually understand what your marketing is doing.
